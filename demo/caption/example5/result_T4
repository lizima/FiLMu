The tempo slows to 68 beats per minute, and the key shifts to F minor. The instrumentation remains largely the same, but the Double BassPizz and Drums take on a more prominent role, creating a sense of depth and rhythm. The chords are more subdued, with C#major and A#minor providing a sense of resolution, but the overall mood is more contemplative and introspective.
