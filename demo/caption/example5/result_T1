The first section, which begins at the start of the clip, is a lively and energetic passage that sets the tone for the entire piece. The tempo is a brisk 137 beats per minute, and the key is G# minor, which gives the music a slightly melancholic tinge. The instrumentation is a fascinating blend of traditional Chinese instruments, including the Jinghu and Balalaika, paired with the BrightPiano and DoubleBassPizz. The chords are expertly woven throughout the section, with a progression that moves from Emajor to D#minor to D#major, creating a sense of tension and release.The second section, which begins at 14 seconds, is a dramatic shift in mood and tempo. The music slows down to a more contemplative 68 beats per minute, and the key shifts to G# major, giving the music a brighter, more uplifting feel. The instrumentation is now dominated by the Fujara, a traditional Eastern European instrument, accompanied by the DoubleBassPizz and Drums.
