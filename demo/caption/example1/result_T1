The first section, starting from the beginning, is a mesmerizing blend of Eastern-inspired instrumentation, featuring the PanFlute, Sitar, OrganBass, and Drums. The tempo is moderate, clocking in at 167 beats per minute, and the key is A major. The chords are expertly woven throughout the section, with Bminor, Eminor, and Amajor making appearances. The PanFlute's airy, flute-like timbre and the Sitar's distinctive plucking create a hypnotic atmosphere, while the OrganBass provides a rich harmonic foundation.As the section comes to a close, the tempo and mood subtly shift, introducing the second section. The tempo slows down to 84 beats per minute, and the key shifts to Fminor. The instrumentation remains largely the same, with the addition of the Jinghu, a traditional Chinese instrument. The chords become more complex, featuring C#major, D#major, C#major, A#minor, C#major, C#minor, and C#major.
